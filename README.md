# jewelry-design - Xiaozi Deng, I will pick up garbage to feed you!
A ring made of mineral water bottle cap, can pull ring and resin. 

In China, many girls spend a lot of money for their stars. In that time, I also chased a star, Xiaozi Deng. In order for him to be more popular, I commented and liked on Weibo, bought the products he endorsed, and gave money to the fan support team. I ate a lot of instant noodles during that time, because instant noodles were cheaper and almost all my money was spent on that idol. I became a crazy fan. In China, these was a popular saying for crazy fans is xxx, I pick up garbage to feed you. It means that the fans will do anything, spend all their money, even pick up garbage and sell it to the recycling department to get money for their idols. Although I was still chasing stars, I decided to focus more on my life. This ring commemorates when I was a crazy fan.
