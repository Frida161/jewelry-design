# jewelry-design - Xiaoci Deng, I will pick up garbage to feed you!
A ring made of mineral water bottle cap, can pull ring and resin. 

In China, many girls spend a lot of money for their stars. I once chased a star, Xiaoci Deng. In order for him to be more popular, I commented and liked on Weibo every day, bought the products he endorsed, and gave money to the fan support team. I ate a lot of instant noodles during that time, because instant noodles were cheaper and almost all my money was spent on that idol. I became a big fan and I was a kind of crazy. In China, these is a popular saying for crazy fans is "xxx(the name of the star), I pick up garbage to feed you!" It means that crazy fans can do everything, spend all their money, even pick up garbage and sell it to the recycling department to get money for their idols. Although I'm still chasing stars, I have decided to focus more on my life. This ring commemorates when I was a big fan. Attached is a love letter for my past favorite idol.
